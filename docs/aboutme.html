      <h1>So who is this guy?</h1>
      <p>Hey,</br></br>
          Don't you want a little insight and background on the person you are interested in hiring.
          To start, I grew up in rural upstate New York. One day when I was little, I was playing my colecovision (I'm not that old,
          we got it used at a garage sale).  I asked my mom some rudimentary questions on how the games were made, and she gave me a
          short explanation to wit I replied "I can do that". Ever since then I wanted to be a programmer.  </br>
          </br>
          I started working young.  Mostly landscaping for a local company.  I used that to put myself through college.  I attended SUNY
          Cobleskill. </br>
          </br>
          After college I got hired at my internship with SUNY Research Foundation.  We were doing contract work for West Point Military
          Acadamy on alternative energy.  Primarily our research was in gasification and alternative fuels.  I was hired on to be the
          programmer for all the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and setting up the Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs). </br></br>
          But as many jobs do, this job grew into more. On top of the programming and data logging for the gasification unit. I also setup,
          calibrated all the instrumentation and made calibration reports, wired up electrical panels, wrote reports, calibrated and operated
          specilized chemistry equipment, including bomb calorimeters, gas chromatographs, and kilns.  I also did autocad drawings and made
          wiring diagrams. Occasionally I even welded!!! I took the iniative on running tests on alternative fuels in a diseal engine on
          the weekends. </br>
          </br>
          Due to Army sequestration, I shifted my focus to more programming focused work.  I started work at LiveTechnology.  This is an
          interesting Ad Company.  There I work with an in-house server side scripting language and do javascript development for them. </br>
          </br>
          This has been an enjoyable company to work for and has helped fuel my passion for billiards, as billiards has always been a
          side hobby for me.
